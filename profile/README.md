## Welcome, we are open ðŸ‘‹

[ProcessOne](https://www.process-one.net) has been focused on building large-scale highly scalable messaging platform since 2002.

We have built our own Open Source software stack, widely known as [ejabberd](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd).

ejabberd supports the following protocols:

- [eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)](https://xmpp.org/)
- [MQTT, The Standard for IoT Messaging](https://mqtt.org)
- [Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), a VoIP standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol)
- [Matrix](https://matrix.org)
- STUN/Turn, tools used to facilitate voice and video connections between parties.

No matter what you are trying to build, our software and skills can help. We focus on make the invisible part just work at scale, so that
you can focus on the special user experience you propose in your client software.

We work on custom project or can provide cost effective managed platforms on [fluux](https://fluux.io).
